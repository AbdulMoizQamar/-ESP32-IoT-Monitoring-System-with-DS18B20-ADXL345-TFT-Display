# -ESP32-IoT-Monitoring-System-with-DS18B20-ADXL345-TFT-Display
This project integrates multiple sensors and a user interface on an ESP32 to create a Wi-Fi-based real-time monitoring system. 

Description:
This project integrates multiple sensors and a user interface on an ESP32 to create a Wi-Fi-based real-time monitoring system. It features:
Temperature sensing using DS18B20
Acceleration monitoring with ADXL345
Wi-Fi configuration via EEPROM and captive portal (AP mode)
Real-time clock using NTP
TFT screen for live data visualization
Button navigation menu
Web server setup for smart connectivity
Designed for embedded system learning, this project showcases peripheral interfacing, EEPROM storage, sensor data acquisition, display control, and network connectivity on the ESP32.
